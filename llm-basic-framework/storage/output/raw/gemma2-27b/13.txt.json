This text describes a sophisticated cyber espionage campaign targeting Ukrainian military personnel and infrastructure. Let's break down the key points:

**Campaign Name:** SickSync

**Threat Actor:** Vermin, a previously inactive threat group known for its targeted attacks against Ukraine.

**Objectives:**

* **Data Exfiltration:** Stealing sensitive information such as documents, communications, and personal data from infected devices.
* **Espionage:** Gathering intelligence on military operations, tactics, and personnel.

**Methods:**

* **FileGrabber:** Uses the `robocopy` command-line tool to copy specific file types (documents, spreadsheets, presentations, images, etc.) from user directories and cloud storage locations like OneDrive.
* **Usb:** Targets removable USB drives, copying a wide range of file types including multimedia files.
* **Social:** Steals authentication and configuration data from popular messaging apps like Telegram, Signal, Skype, and Element.
* **Browsers:** Extracts login credentials, session data, browsing history, and other sensitive information from web browsers like Firefox, Chrome, Edge, and others.

**Exfiltration Mechanism:**

* The stolen data is copied to subfolders within the `%APPDATA%\sync\Slave_Sync\` directory.
* SyncThing, a legitimate open-source file synchronization tool, is then used to transfer the data to a server controlled by the attackers.

**Network Indicators:**

* Peer-to-peer connections with *.syncthing.net domain are indicative of SyncThing activity and potential involvement in the SickSync campaign.

**Recommendations for Mitigation:**


* **Contact the Center for Cyber Security of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (CSOC) immediately:**
    * Email: csoc@post.mil.gov.ua
    * Signal: +380673321891
* **Deploy appropriate security technologies on all devices.**
* **Enable Syslog logging on network boundary devices to monitor and analyze network traffic for suspicious activity.**

**Key Takeaways:**

* SickSync is a serious threat targeting Ukrainian military personnel.
* The attackers are using sophisticated techniques to steal sensitive data and avoid detection.
* Prompt action and implementation of security measures are crucial to mitigating the risks posed by this campaign.
