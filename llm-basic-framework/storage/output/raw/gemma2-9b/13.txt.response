The document describes a cybersecurity incident involving the UAC-0020 (Vermin) hacking group targeting Ukrainian Armed Forces (UAF).

**Here's a breakdown:**

* **Target:**  Ukrainian Armed Forces
* **Actors:** UAC-0020 (Vermin), a previously active group with ties to Russian-occupied Luhansk
* **Campaign Name:** "SickSync" 

**Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs):**

1. **Spear Phishing Email:**  An email containing a malicious archive ("turrel.fop.volchok.rar") disguised as legitimate content was sent to targets.

2. **Exploitation of Legitimate Software:**
    * The archive contained a file named "sync.exe", which presented as a legitimate SyncThing installation but also bundled malware (SPECTR). 
    * SyncThing is used for file synchronization, and the attackers exploited its peer-to-peer functionality to exfiltrate stolen data.

3. **SPECTR Malware:** This malicious software suite includes functionalities like:
    * **SpecMon:** Loads additional malware modules.
    * **Screengrabber:** Captures screenshots of specific applications frequently used for sensitive communication or document editing.
    * **FileGrabber:** Steals files from various user folders and removable devices, targeting common file types (.doc, .pdf, .jpg, etc.).
    * **Usb:** Similar to FileGrabber but focuses on data extracted from USB drives.
    * **Social:** Extracts authentication data from messaging apps like Telegram, Signal, and Skype.
    * **Browsers:** Steals browsing history, cookies, and login information from various web browsers.

4. **Exfiltration:** Stolen data is moved to temporary folders within the SyncThing directory, then transferred to the attacker's system via the peer-to-peer connection.

**Indicators of Compromise (IOCs):**

* Domain: *.syncthing.net


**Recommendations:**

* UAF personnel should immediately contact the Center for Cybersecurity of the Armed Forces of Ukraine for guidance and security solutions.
* Implement robust endpoint protection measures, including antivirus software and regular updates. 
* Educate users about phishing risks and best practices for identifying malicious emails.
* Configure firewalls and intrusion detection systems to monitor network traffic for suspicious activity.

**Overall:** The "SickSync" campaign highlights the increasing sophistication of cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructure and national security.
