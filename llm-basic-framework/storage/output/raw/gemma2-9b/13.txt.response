This Ukrainian CERT report describes a new cyberattack campaign by the UAC-0020 (Vermin) threat group targeting Ukrainian Armed Forces. 

**Key Takeaways:**

* **Target:** Ukrainian Armed Forces
* **Attacker:** UAC-0020 (Vermin) - a group known to operate out of occupied Luhansk, previously active in March 2022.
* **Method:** SPECTR malware delivered through a spear phishing email with a malicious SyncThing installer.

**Tactics:**

1. **Spear Phishing:** Victims received emails containing a password-protected archive leading to an executable installer ("sync.exe") disguised as legitimate SyncThing software. 

2. **Malicious SyncThing Installer:** The "sync.exe" file contains both legitimate SyncThing components and SPECTR malware, with modifications made to alter SyncThing behavior.

3. **SPECTR Malware Modules:**
    * **SpecMon:** Loads additional DLL files containing IPlugin classes for potential reconnaissance and command execution.
    * **Screengrabber:** Captures screenshots every 10 seconds when specific application windows are active (e.g., Office, communication apps, browsers).
    * **FileGrabber:**  Copies sensitive files from various user directories and removable devices.
    * **Usb:** Copies files with specific extensions from USB drives.
    * **Social:** Steals configuration data from messaging apps like Telegram, Signal, and Skype.
    * **Browsers:** Extracts authentication details, session data, and browsing history from popular web browsers.

4. **Exfiltration through SyncThing:** Stolen information is copied to a dedicated directory within the SyncThing folder and then transferred to the attacker's machine via SyncThing's peer-to-peer synchronization mechanism.

**Indicators of Compromise (IOCs):**

* The report mentions specific network indicators, such as *.syncthing.net, related to SyncThing infrastructure.


**Recommendations:**

* **Security Professionals:** 
    * Immediately implement robust security measures on all systems within the Ukrainian Armed Forces' network to mitigate this threat.
    * Install and update endpoint protection software capable of detecting and neutralizing SPECTR malware.
    * Enforce strong password policies, multi-factor authentication, and regular vulnerability patching.

* **Individuals:** 
    * Be cautious about opening email attachments from unknown senders.
    * Keep all software updated to patch known vulnerabilities.


**Conclusion:** This campaign highlights the ongoing threat posed by sophisticated cyber actors targeting critical infrastructure and national security.  The use of legitimate software like SyncThing for malicious purposes underscores the need for vigilance and comprehensive cybersecurity practices.
